📘 LeetCode DSA Journey

    Welcome to my LeetCode Practice Repository 🚀
    This repo contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, uploaded in order of their problem numbers.
    I am documenting my DSA journey from Day 1, solving problems consistently to build strong problem-solving skills.

📂 Repository Structure

    Each file is named as: <ProblemNumber>.cpp
    
    Example:
          📁 LeetCode-DSA
             ┣ 📜 Probkem_34.cpp
             ┣ 📜 Probkem_87.cpp
             ┣ 📜 Probkem_67.cpp
             ┣ 📜 Probkem_121.cpp
             ┗ 📜 README.md

🗓️ My Plan

    📅 Solve daily → 1–2 problems minimum.
    
    🟢 Start with Easy problems to build fundamentals.
    
    🟡 Progress to Medium problems for patterns & logic.
    
    🔴 Challenge myself with Hard problems over time.

🚀 Topics Covered

    ✔ Arrays
    ✔ Strings
    ✔ Binary Search
    ✔ Sorting & Searching
    ✔ Recursion & Backtracking
    ✔ Linked List
    ✔ Stack & Queue
    ✔ Trees & Graphs
    ✔ Dynamic Programming
    ✔ Greedy Algorithms
    
    (Continuously updating as I progress ⏳)


🛠️ Languages Used
    C++ (Primary)
    May add Python and Java versions later.


🎯 Goals
      ✅ Build DSA foundations from scratch.
      ✅ Stay consistent with problem-solving.
      ✅ Prepare for coding interviews and placements.

📌 Notes

      Solutions are named after their LeetCode problem number for easy reference.
      Each file may contain:
      Problem statement (short description).
      My approach & explanation (in comments).
